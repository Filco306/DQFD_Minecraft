# MineRL Imitation Learning

This github code is for solving a MineRLTreechop-v0, MineRLNavigate-v0 environment. I use a Convolution Neural Network for traning a agent. 

After finishing a training, agent can go to a one of tree in environment and attack it for collecting wood. But, it stops it's move at then. Thus, agent can collect only 1 reward.

I need to solve this problem.
