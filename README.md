# MineRL Imitation Learning

This github code is for solving a MineRLTreechop-v0, MineRLNavigate-v0 environment. I use a Convolution Neural Network for traning a agent. 

After finishing a training, agent can go to a one of tree in environment and attack it for collecting wood. But, it stops it's move at then. Thus, agent can collect only 1 reward.

I need to solve this problem.

# How to use it

First, you need to install dependent package by using a requirement.txt file. 

Second, you need to modify a path for model and summary of tensorflow in MineRL_IL.ipynb file.

Third, you should check code operate properly by running IPython Notebook.
