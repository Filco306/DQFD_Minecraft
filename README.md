# Introduction
I am reproducing content of paper(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08664v2.pdf) of winner of first Minecraft Reinforcement Learning challge of NeurIPS 2019.

# Reference
1. https://github.com/AurelianTactics/dqfd-with-keras : I mainly use preprocessig code of that repo and change Keras based code to to Tensorflow
2. https://github.com/go2sea/DQfD : DQDF of that repo code is clean and good for knowing main idea of algorithm.

# How to run 
1. Simple DQN code for navigation task : Open and run MineRL_Navigate_DQN.ipynb file.
2. Basic DQFQ code for treechop task : Run dqfd_treechop.py file.

# Dependencies
1. MineRL : pip install minerl
2. Tensorflow : pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1

# Detailed inforamtion
More information will be updated soon on edium.
